Techiee is an experimental Discord AI Chatbot based on Google's Gemini Pro.

Techiee is still WIP, so not everything works yet!

If you wanna fork this repo, you can, but, there are much better chatbots based on Gemini to fork.

## What CAN Techie do?

Techiee is... Well, a chatbot, like ChatGPT or Gemini. It uses the same Gemini (models) that Gemini (the chatbot) is based on, however, in Discord!

## Here's how YOU can configure Techiee

You can tweak settings like the safety settings, temperature, TopK etc.

All you'll need to do is to set the environment secrets for the Discord Channel ID, your Discord Bot Token (https://discord.com/developers/applications) and your Google AI Studio API Key (which you can grab from https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

You can use a hosting service like Render (which is free and works just fine) (render.com), grab your web server URL, and then use the keep_alive.cjs file to run it 24/7 with UptimeRobot (you can find detailed tutorials online)

We can't use Replit (at least, if you want to host it 24/7 for free) because they killed their webservers. You can pay Replit to get it running 24/7 with their new "Deployments" if you want.

### Features done

✅ The actual bot
✅ 24/7

### Features being worked on

- History log (it like half-works? Most of the time it doesn't work but something happens once in a blue moon and it decides to remember stuff.)
- Safety settings (same thing the history log)

### Features to-do

- There currently aren't any features we want to work on that we haven't started working on yet.
