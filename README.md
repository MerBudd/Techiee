## This is the JavaScript version of Techiee! For the much better and much more advanced version of Techiee, go to [Techiee.py](https://github.com/MerBudd/Techiee.py). If you want to fork this repo, you can, but there are much better chatbots based on Gemini (including [Techiee.py](https://github.com/MerBudd/Techiee)) to fork! Many of Techiee.js' functions still aren't done!

## What is Techiee?

Techiee is... Well, a chatbot, like ChatGPT or Gemini. It uses the same Gemini (models) that Gemini (the chatbot) is based on, however, in Discord!

Techiee can be VERY random, but I love him for that...

## How to configure Techiee

You can tweak settings like the safety settings, temperature, TopK, etc. inside the "configs" section of main.js

You can check out [SETUP.md](https://github.com/MerBudd/Techiee.js/blob/main/SETUP.md) for instructions on how to run it locally or with a hosting service (Render) and run it 24/7.
